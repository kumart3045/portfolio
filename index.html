            <h3>Thrisha Kumar</h3>
            <p> An aspiring Graphic and UI/UX designer, always finding new things to learn. As  someone who has always been into art, I came upon digital design in high school, fell in love, and have been in a long-term relationship since. You’ll find me getting lost inside my work, sometimes losing track of time. I demonstrate consistent progress in my work, always try to better it, and bringing out my best. I value collaboration and advocate for inclusive environments. Leadership is something that comes to me naturally, and I love hearing everyone’s voices. Problem-solving and creativity are skills I’ve built my entire life, and continue to excel in. 

            Outside my design world, you’ll find me editing videos for fun or keeping up with my 30 different hobbies. I love the outdoors and exploring new cultures and cuisines. Travel has always been a big part of my life, and I’m always open to new countries and expanding my knowledge, adding more languages to my list of proficiency in 6 languages. </p>
